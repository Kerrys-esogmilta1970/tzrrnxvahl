Okay, I'm not even sure where to start. Just got out of 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Cleaner, and my brain feels like a tossed salad that someone left out in the sun too long. I mean, what was that rollercoaster of a  ? One moment I'm thinking “wow, deep,” and the next I’m like, “what the heck just happened on-screen?” Honestly, I'm a bit tired, probably from trying to wrap my head around the storyline. Or was it the popcorn? Probably both.

So, for those not in the know, Cleaner follows a crime scene cleaner who gets caught up in a murder drama. Yeah, because that’s what we all need on a Tuesday night, more murder. But, oh man, the main guy—what's his name again? Uh, nevermind, I’ll Google it later or maybe I won't. He just drags you through this gritty world, and at points, I'm torn between admiring his moxie and feeling completely sorry for him. Dude needs a vacation, or, I dunno, a hug.

> There was a scene with a mop that I swear was more intense than any car chase I’ve seen this year. A mop! You’d think they’d be boring, right? Wrong. Might start looking at my own mop with a bit more respect from now on.

And the other characters? They pop in and out like it’s a revolving door of weird. There’s this part with a detective who acts like he’s in some sort of noir   marathon and I couldn’t tell if he was serious or if I’d accidentally 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed the parody version. But it works, in an oddball kind of way.

Funny enough, I found myself playing a little game where I'd guess how long it would take for things to get even more chaotic. A mop segment, detective with a coffee fixation, sudden plot twists—you name it, this  ’s got it. It's as if someone threw a dart at a board of random plot elements and said, Yes! All of the above!

    return This mop deserves an Oscar.

By the end, I’m walking out trying to process it all but realizing maybe I'm too brain-fried to make sense of it. If you're looking for something to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 while your brain is already at full capacity, Cleaner might just push you over the edge. Or is that just me projecting? Anyway, it's worth a try. Maybe 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 it, maybe 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it, let it confuse you. You do you.
